___
#### AZ-104: Prerequisites for Azure administrators

## Introduction: 

Moving to the cloud and taking on a role as an Azure developer, solution architect, or administrator requires knowing the foundations for how networking works, and how to use different devices to build networks. While networks are made up of various network devices, there are other aspects to keep in mind as well. For example, network communication protocols require devices to have network addresses assigned. You'll also need to secure your network to protect your organization's assets and resources.
