# Fundamentals of computer networking 

___
#### AZ-104: Prerequisites for Azure administrators

## Introduction: 

Moving to the cloud and taking on a role as an Azure developer, solution architect, or administrator requires knowing the foundations for how networking works, and how to use different devices to build networks. While networks are made up of various network devices, there are other aspects to keep in mind as well. For example, network communication protocols require devices to have network addresses assigned. You'll also need to secure your network to protect your organization's assets and resources. 

--> Learning Objective: 

* Describe the differences between WAN, PAN, and LAN
* List the different network protocols and network standards 
* Describe network communication concepts like TCP/IP model, DNS, and ports.
* Describe how these core components map to Azure networking. 



## Network types and topologies to use when you design a network: 

All networks are built on the same principles. You can apply these principles to design and build your organization's local or cloud-based networks. When you build a network, you need to know about the different types of networks, their topologies, and their uses. 

---> What is a network? 

A network is a collection of networks-enabled devices, typically made up of computers, switches, routers, printers, and servers. Networks are a fundamental part of day-to-day life and exists in homes, workplaces, and public areas. Networks allow all types of network-enabled devices to communicate. 

---> Network types

Networks vary in size, shape, and usage. To make it easier to identify different network types they're categorized into one of the following network categories: 

* Personal area networks 
* Local area networks
* Metropolitan area networks 
* Wide area networks
