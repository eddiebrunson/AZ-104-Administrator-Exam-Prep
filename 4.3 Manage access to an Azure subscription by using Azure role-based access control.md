# Manage access to an Azure subscription by using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)
___

## Manage identities and governance in Azure

### Introduction: 

In this module, you will:

* Identify the appropriate role to assign to an employee.
* Identify scenarios where the Global Administrator for Azure Active Directory might need to temporarily elevate their access in Azure.
* Grant the employee administrator access to a subscription.



### Understand the difference between Azure roles and Azure AD roles:

Azure resources and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) have independent permission systems. Azure roles are used to manage access to virtual machines, storage, and other Azure resources. Azure AD roles are used to manage access to Azure AD resources, such as user accounts and passwords.
In this unit, you'll look at the essential aspects of Azure roles and Azure AD roles. You'll explore the various scopes available to you. You'll then identify the right roles to assign, depending on the scenario.

### Understand when you might need to elevate your access:

####  When to elevate access
By default, a Global Administrator doesn't have access to Azure resources. The Global Administrator for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) can temporarily elevate their permissions to the Azure role of User Access Administrator. This action grants the Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permissions that are needed to manage Azure resources. The User Access Administrator is assigned at the scope of root. The role can view all resources in, and assign access to, any subscription or management group in that Azure AD organization.

The following diagram shows what resources the Global Administrator can view when their permissions are elevated to User Access Administrator.
