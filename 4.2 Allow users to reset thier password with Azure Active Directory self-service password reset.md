### Introduction: 

### What is self-service password reset in Azure Active Directory? 

In Azure AD, any user can change their password if they're already signed in. But if they're not signed in and forgot their password or it's expired, they'll need to reset their password. With SSPR, users can reset their passwords in a web browser or from a Windows sign-in screen to regain access to Azure, Microsoft 365, and any other application that uses Azure AD for authentication.

SSPR reduces the load on administrators, because users can fix password problems themselves, without having to call the help desk. Also, it minimizes the productivity impact of a forgotten or expired password. Users don't have to wait until an administrator is available to reset their password.

#### How SSPR works
The user initiates a password reset either by going directly to the password reset portal or by selecting the Can't access your account link on a sign-in page. The reset portal takes these steps:
1. Localization: The portal checks the browser's locale setting and renders the SSPR page in the appropriate language.
2. Verification: The user enters their username and passes a captcha to ensure that it's a user and not a bot.
3. Authentication: The user enters the required data to authenticate their identity. They might, for example, enter a code or answer security questions.
4. Password reset: If the user passes the authentication tests, they can enter a new password and confirm it.
5. Notification: A message is usually sent to the user to confirm the reset.
There are several ways you can customize the SSPR user experience. For example, you can add your company logo to the sign-in page so users know that they're in the right place to reset their password.

### Summary: 


An administrator doesn't have to do the password reset. SSPR is secured by authentication methods of your choice. These methods can include a mobile authentication app, a code sent to you by an SMS text message, or security questions.
SSPR helps reduce the amount of work required from administrators. It also minimizes the productivity impact for users when they forget their password.
