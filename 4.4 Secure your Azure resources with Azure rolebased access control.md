# Secure your Azure resources with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)

___

## Manage identities and governance in Azure

### Introduction: 

Securing your Azure resources, such as virtual machines, websites, networks, and storage, is a critical function for any organization using the cloud. You want to ensure that your data and assets are protected, but still grant your employees and partners the access they need to perform their jobs. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is an authorization system in Azure that helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and where they have access.


As an example, suppose you work for First Up Consultants, which is an engineering firm that specializes in circuit and electrical design. They've moved their workloads and assets to Azure to make collaboration easier across several offices and other companies. You work in the IT department at First Up Consultants, where you are responsible for keeping the company's assets secure, but still allowing users to access the resources they need. You've heard that Azure RBAC can help you manage resources in Azure.

In this module, you will learn how to use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage access to resources in Azure.


### What is Azure RBAC?

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management of resources in Azure. With Azure RBAC, you can grant the exact access that users need to do their jobs. For example, you can use Azure RBAC to let one employee manage virtual machines in a subscription while another manages SQL databases within the same subscription.
