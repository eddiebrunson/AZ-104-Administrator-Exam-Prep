# Introduction to Azure virtual machines

#### AZ-104: Prerequisites for Azure administrators


## Introduction: 

Suppose you work for a company doing medical research and you're responsible for managing the on-premises servers. The servers you administer run all the company infrastructure, from web servers to databases. However, the hardware is aging and starting to struggle to keep up with some of the new data analysis applications being deployed to it. 

You could upgrade all the hardware, but that's not appealing for several reasons: 

1. The servers are physically scattered all around the world with minimal staff in each location. We'd like to centralize the upgrade to our home office. 
2. The company runs custom data analysis software on several versions and flavors of Windows and Linux, sometimes set up with odd configurations that aren't entirely understood. We need a way to test our deployments completely and try different configurations to make sure everything is working before we transition the work. 

3. Business is booming, and the company is growing fast. It's likely that the load on the internal servers, particularly the databases, will continue to grow, requiring us to either buy for the future or come up with a scaling plan to handle the growth. 

For these reasons, it's decided that it is time to explore the cloud to see if it can help solve the load and scale problem. Since you have a bunch of mixed servers and custom software, it makes sense to look at trying to move servers one at a time into Azure using Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)


Azure VMs are one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. With VMs, you have total control over the configuration and can install anything you need to perform the work. You don't need to purchase physical hardware when you need to scale or extend your datacenter. Finally, Azure provides additional services to monitor, secure, and manages updates and patches to the OS>

## Compile a checklist for creating an Azure Virtual Machine: 

Performing a migration of on-premises servers to Azure requires planning and care. You can move them all at once, or more likely, in small batches or even individually. Before you create a single VM, you should sit down and sketch out your current infrastructure model and see how it might map to the cloud. 

Checklist of things to think about:

* Start with the network 
* Name the VM 
* Decide the location for the VM 
* Determine the size of the VM 
* Understanding the pricing model 
* Storage for the VM 
* Select an operating system 

--> Start with the network

The first thing you should think about isn't the virtual machine at all -it's the network. 

Virtual networks (VNets) are used in Azure to provide private connectivity between Azure Virtual Machines and other Azure services. VMs and services that are part of the same virtual network can access one another. By default, services outside the virtual network cannot connect to services within the virtual network. You can, however, configure the network to allow access to the external service, including your on premises servers. 

This latter point is why you should spend some time thinking about your network configuration. Network addresses and subnets are not trivial to change once you have them set upm and if you plan to connect your private company network to the Azure services, you will want to make sure you consider the topology, before putting any VMs into place. 

When you set up a virtual network, you specify the available address spaces, subnets, and security. If the VNets will be connected to other VNets, you must select address ranges that are not overlapping. This is the range of private addresses that the VMs and services in your network can use. You can use unroutable IP addresses such as 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16, or define your own range. Azure will treat any address range as part of the private VNet IP address space if it is only reachable within the VNet, within interconnected VNets, and from your on-premises location. If someone else is responsible for the internal networks, you should work with that person before selecting your address space to make sure there is no overlap and to let them know what space you want to use, so they don't try to use the same range of IP addresses. 



--> Segregate your network 

After deciding the virtual network address space(s), you can create one or more subnets for your virtual network. You do this to break up your network into more manageable sections. For example, you might assign 10.1.0.0 to VMs, 10.2.0.0 to back-end services, and 10.3.0.0 to SQL Server VMs.

> Note: Azure reserves the first four addresses and the last address in each subnet for its use. 

--> Secure the network 

By default, there is no security boundary between subnets, so services in each of these subnets can talk to one another. However, you can set up Network Security Groups (NSGs), which allow you to control the traffic flow to and from subnets and to and from VMs. NSGs act as software firewalls, applying custom rules to each inbound or outbound request at the network interface and subnet level. This allows you to fully control every network request coming in or out of the VM. 

--> Plan each VM deployment 

Once you have mapped out your communication and network requirements, you can start thinking about the VMs you want to create. A good plan is to select a server and take an inventory: 

* What does the server communicate with? 
* Which ports are open? 
* How much disk space is in use? 
* What kind of data does this use? Are there restrictions (legal or otherwise) with not having it on-premises? 
* What sort of CPU, memory, and disk I/O load does the server have? Is there burst traffic to account for? 

--> Name the VM


--> What is Azure resource? 


--> Determine the size of the VM

--> What if my size needs change? 

--> Understanding the pricing model

--> Storage for the VM

--> What is Azure Storage?

Azure Storage is Microsoft's cloud-based data storage solution. It supports almost any type of data and provides security redundancy, and scalable access to the stored data. 

--> Select an operating system




## Exercise - Create a VM using the Azure portal: 

Options to create and manage VMs

--> Azure portal 

The Azure portal provides an easy-to-use browser-based user interface that allows you to create and manage all your Azure resources. For example, you can set up a new database, increase the compute power of your virtual machines, and monitor your monthly costs. It's also a great learning tool, since you can survey all available resources and use guided wizards to create the ones you need. 

Once you're signed in, you're presented with two main areas. The first is a menu with options to help you create resources, monitor resources, and manage billing. The second is the home page that shows some of the most commonly used services. You'll most likely find the portal the most comfortable option to use when you start using Azure.
