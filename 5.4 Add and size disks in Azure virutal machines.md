### Add and size disks in Azure virtual machines 

___

### Introduction: 

You're the system architect for a law firm. The firm has asked you to migrate critical systems to Azure. Operations include the database of case histories, currently hosted by an on-premises SQL server and accessed from a desktop application. The SQL server also runs some custom in-house services to perform database maintenance. You've decided that a solution based on Azure virtual machines (VMs) will allow you to host your SQL server and continue using your custom services. You'll create an Azure virtual hard disk based on the contents of your existing on-premises server to ease migration.

In this module, you'll learn how to architect the optimal disk configuration for the VMs you create in Azure.

### How disk are used by VMs

VMs use disks for three different purposes:

* Operating system storage. Every VM includes one disk that stores the operating system. This drive is registered as a SATA drive and labeled as the C: drive in Windows and mounted at "/" in Unix-like operating systems. It has a maximum capacity of 4,095 gibibytes (GiB), and its content is taken from the VM image you used to create the VM.

* Temporary storage. Every VM includes a temporary VHD that is used for page and swap files. Data on this drive may be lost during a maintenance event or redeployment. The drive is labeled as D: on a Windows VM by default. Do not use this drive to store important data that you do not want to lose.

* Data storage. A data disk is any other disk attached to a VM. You use data disks to store files, databases, and any other data that you need to persist across reboots. Some VM images include data disks by default. You can also add additional data disks up to the maximum number specified by the size of the VM. Each data disk is registered as a SCSI drive and has a max capacity of 32,767 GiB. You can choose drive letters or mount points for your data drives.
