# Create custom roles for Azure resources with role-based access control (RBAC)

___

## Manage identities and governance

### Introduction: 

Suppose you work for an organization where your team manages a website hosted on Azure VMs. You're assigned the Owner role for the subscription that contains the website's resources. To keep Azure resources secure, you segregate duties within your team and only grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job. You have a new employee who's responsible for managing VMs within the subscription. They need to monitor and do troubleshooting tasks like restarting the VMs.


### What are custom roles in Azure?:

Sometimes, the built-in roles don't grant the precise level of access you need. Custom roles allow you to define roles that meet the specific needs of your organization. You can assign the Azure custom roles you create to users, groups, and service principals at the scope of subscription, resource group, or resource.
In this unit, you learn about custom roles in Azure role-based access control (RBAC).
