# Manage users and groups in Azure Active Directory:

## Manage identities and governance in Azure

### Introduction: 

### What is Azure Active Directory? 

While they share a similar name, Azure AD is not a cloud version of Windows Server Active Directory. It's also not intended as a complete replacement for an on-premises Active Directory. Instead, if you're already using a Windows AD server, you can connect it to Azure AD to extend your directory into Azure. This approach allows users to use the same credentials to access local and cloud-based resources.

### Create and manage users:

Every user who needs access to Azure resources needs an Azure user account. A user account contains all the information needed to authenticate the user during the sign-on process. Once authenticated, Azure AD builds an access token to authorize the user and determine what resources they can access and what they can do with those resources.
You use the Azure Active Directory dashboard in the Azure portal to work with user objects. Keep in mind that you can only work with a single directory at a time - but you can use the Directory + Subscription panel to switch directories. The dashboard also has a Switch directory button in the toolbar which makes it easy to switch to another available directory.


### Create and manage groups: 

An Azure AD group helps organize users making it easier to manage permissions. Using groups lets the resource owner (or Azure AD directory owner), assign a set of access permissions to all the members of the group, instead of having to provide the rights one-by-one. Groups allow us to define a security boundary and then add and remove specific users to grant or deny access with a minimum amount of effort. Even better, Azure AD supports the ability to define membership based on rules - such as what department a user works in, or the job title they have.

Azure AD allows you to define two different types of groups.

1. Security groups. These are the most common and are used to manage member and computer access to shared resources for a group of users. For example, you can create a security group for a specific security policy. By doing it this way, you can give a set of permissions to all the members at once, instead of having to add permissions to each member individually. This option requires an Azure AD administrator.

2. Microsoft 365 groups. These groups provide collaboration opportunities by giving members access to a shared mailbox, calendar, files, SharePoint site, and more. This option also lets you give people outside of your organization access to the group. This option is available to users as well as admins.

### Use roles to control resource access: 

#### Built-in roles for Azure Resources (uses PowerShell)
Azure AD provides several built-in roles to cover the most common security scenarios. To understand how the roles work, let's examine three roles that apply to all resource types:

* **Owner**, which has full access to all resources, including the right to delegate access to others.
* **Contributor**, which can create and manage all types of Azure resources but can’t grant access to others.
* **Reader**, which can view existing Azure resources.

#### Role definitions

Each role is a set of properties defined in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. This role definition includes a Name, ID, and Description. It also includes the allowable permissions (Actions), denied permissions (NotActions), and scope (for example, read access) for the role.
For the Owner role, that means all actions, indicated by an asterisk (*); no denied actions; and all scopes, indicated by a forward slash (/).

You can get this information using the PowerShell `Get-AzRmRoleDefinition cmdlet.`

### Connect Active Directory to Azure AD with Azure AD Connect: 


Companies that use an on-premises Windows Server Active Directory solution can integrate their existing users and groups with Azure Active Directory with Azure AD Connect. This is a free tool you can download and install to synchronize your local AD with your Azure directory.
With Azure AD Connect, you can provide your users with a common identity for Microsoft 365, Azure, and SaaS applications integrated with Azure AD in a hybrid identity environment.

#### What's included in Azure AD Connect?
Azure AD Connect provides several components that you can install to create a hybrid identity system.

* Sync services. This component is responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects. It also makes sure that identity information for your on-premises users and groups matches that in the cloud.
* Health monitoring. Azure AD Connect Health supplies robust monitoring and a central location in the Azure portal for viewing this activity.
* AD FS. Federation is an optional part of Azure AD Connect that you can use to configure a hybrid environment via an on-premises AD FS infrastructure. Organizations can use this to address complex deployments, such as domain join SSO, enforcement of the Active Directory sign-in policy, and smart card or third-party multi-factor authentication.
* Password hash synchronization. This feature is a sign-in method that synchronizes a hash of a user’s on-premises Active Directory password with Azure AD.
* Pass-through authentication. This allows users to sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using the same passwords. This reduces IT helpdesk costs because users are less likely to forget how to sign in. This feature provides an alternative to Password hash synchronization that allows organizations to enforce their security and password complexity policies.

### Summary: 

Azure Active Directory is the hub for user management in the cloud. It provides a single-sign on capability that makes it easier to onboard new employees and ensure you remove access from previous employees. It integrates tightly with your on-premise Windows Server Active Directory so you have a seamless login experience across all your local and cloud-based resources, and it integrates with other cloud environments like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Dropbox, or Google. Finally, it can reduce your IT burden through its centralized management portal, support for self-service password resets, multi-factor authentication for increased security, high-reliability, and support for managing users and groups with roles.
