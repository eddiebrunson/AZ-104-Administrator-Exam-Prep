# Control and organize Azure resources with Azure Resource Manager 
___

## Manage identities and governance in Azure

### Introduction: 

Imagine you've joined a company who has been moving to the cloud. This movement happened organically across different departments, and resulted in a lack of awareness of what's already been created and where everything is. There's no ability to easily determine who owns which resources. There's no enforcement of standards for things like resource names, resource sizes, and geographic locations. There's also been several instances where critical resources were inadvertently deleted, causing business-critical outages.

Your manager has asked you to head up an effort to put some order into the chaos, but you're new to Azure and aren't entirely sure what you can do to make this better.

Azure Resource Manager has a number of features that you can use to organize resources, enforce standards, and protect critical Azure resources from accidental deletion. You'll take a tour through these features, and show how you can use them to your advantage.

### Principles of resource groups: 

In your first week on your new job, you've looked through the existing resources in your company's Azure subscription. There are a number of resource groups that contain many different resources, but they aren't organized into a coherent structure. You've worked on Azure before, but aren't entirely sure how resource groups work and what their role is. You've guessed (correctly) that they can play a role in how you organize your resources. Let's look at what they are, and how they can be used.

### Use tagging to organize resources:

You've gone through your resources and moved them into resource groups that are more organized than before. But what if resources have multiple uses? How do you better search, filter, and organize these resources? Tags can be helpful as you look to improve organization of your Azure resources.

#### What are tags?
Tags are name/value pairs of text data that you can apply to resources and resource groups. Tags allow you to associate custom details about your resource, in addition to the standard Azure properties a resource has the following properties:
* department (like finance, marketing, and more)
* environment (prod, test, dev)
* cost center
* life cycle and automation (like shutdown and startup of virtual machines)

A resource can have up to 50 tags. The name is limited to 512 characters for all types of resources except storage accounts, which have a limit of 128 characters. The tag value is limited to 256 characters for all types of resources. Tags aren't inherited from parent resources. Not all resource types support tags, and tags can't be applied to classic resources.

### Use policies to enforce standards: 

You're organizing your resources better in resource groups, and you've applied tags to your resources to use them in billing reports and in your monitoring solution. Resource grouping and tagging have made a difference in the existing resources, but how do you ensure that new resources follow the rules? You'll take a look at how policies can help you enforce standards in your Azure environment.

### Secure resources with role-based access control: 

#### What is Azure Policy?

Azure Policy is a service you can use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies apply and enforce rules that your resources need to follow. These policies can enforce these rules when resources are created, and can be evaluated against existing resources to give visibility into compliance.
Policies can enforce things such as only allowing specific types of resources to be created, or only allowing resources in specific Azure regions. You can enforce naming conventions across your Azure environment. You can also enforce that specific tags are applied to resources. You'll take a look at how policies work.

### Use resource locks to protect resources: 

Implementing Azure Policy ensured that all our employees with Azure access are following our internal standards for creating resources, but we have a second issue we need to solve: how do we protect those resources once they are deployed? We have IT personnel that need to manage settings, developers that need to have read-only access, and administrators that need to be able to control them completely. Enter Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

RBAC provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources, enabling you to grant users the specific rights they need to perform their jobs. RBAC is considered a core service and is included with all subscription levels at no cost.

Using RBAC, you can:
* Allow one user to manage VMs in a subscription, and another user to manage virtual networks.
* Allow a database administrator (DBA) group to manage SQL databases in a subscription.
* Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as VMs, websites, and virtual subnets.
* Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group.

To view access permissions, use the Access control (IAM) panel for the resource in the Azure portal. On this panel, you can see who can access an area and their assigned role. Using this same panel, you can also grant or remove access.
